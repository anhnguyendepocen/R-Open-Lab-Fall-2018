# R-Open-Lab-Fall-2018
This repository is created for the purpose of R Open Labs in Fall 2018. After each lab, I will create files corresponding to the scripts covered in the open lab so that people who didn't attend can learn on their own and those who were present can always go back for future reference.

I hope holding these open labs and sharing these materials will introduce R, the fascinating open-source programming language, to more people who find it useful.
